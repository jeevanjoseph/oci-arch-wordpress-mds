1. Click [![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://console.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?region=home&zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-arch-wordpress-mds/raw/main/resource-manager/oci-arch-wordpress-mds.zip)

    If you aren't already signed in, when prompted, enter the tenancy and user credentials.

2. Review and accept the terms and conditions.

## Deploy Using the Terraform CLI

### Clone the Module

Now, you'll want a local copy of this repo. You can make that with the commands:

```
    git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-arch-wordpress-mds.git
    cd oci-arch-wordpress-mds
    ls
```

### Prerequisites
First off, you'll need to do some pre-deploy setup.  That's all detailed [here](https://github.com/cloud-partners/oci-prerequisites).

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file, and specify the following variables:

```
# Authentication
tenancy_ocid         = "<tenancy_ocid>"
user_ocid            = "<user_ocid>"
fingerprint          = "<finger_print>"
private_key_path     = "<pem_private_key_path>"

# Region
region = "<oci_region>"

# Availablity Domain 
availablity_domain_name = "<availablity_domain_name>"

# Compartment
compartment_ocid = "<compartment_ocid>"

# MySQL DBSystem Admin Password 
admin_password = "<admin_password>"

````

### Create the Resources
Run the following commands:

    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply


### Testing your Deployment
After the deployment is finished, you can test if your Wordpress CMS has been deployed correctly (access to configuration wizard). From outputes please pick up the value of the wordpress_public_ip:

````
wordpress_public_ip = 193.122.198.19
`````

Then copy it into Web browser. Here is the example of the succesfull outcome:

### Destroy the Deployment
When you no longer need the deployment, you can run this command to destroy the resources:

    terraform destroy
